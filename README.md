# Responsifyzrly

Responsiwazzit was built to provide functionality similar to [Adaptive Images] (https://github.com/MattWilcox/Adaptive-Images) without prescribing a method of implementation, therefore it takes the form of a tiny library that will handle image generation and serving but won't do it automatically and leaves cache handling up to the developer.

There is one Javascript file, one PHP file, and one image to include in your project.

## responsifyzrly.js

* Sets a cookie containing the target device width (reported), the target device pixel ratio, and the measured available bandwidth.
* Should be included in the `<head>` of your HTML document.
* The script allows for several options for customization and testing purposes.
 * **speedTestUri** - relative path to the bandwidth testing image
 * **speedTestKB** - the size, in kilobytes, of the bandwidth testing image
 * **speedTestTimeout** - time, in milliseconds, to wait before aborting the bandwidth test
 * **speedTestForceBandwidth** - force a bandwidth measurement for testing
 * **cookieExpire** - time, in minutes, until the cookie expires
 * **forceRefresh** - force the browser to refresh once after setting the cookie - this assures that the cookie will be set for all image requests
 * **forcePixelRatio** - force a pixel ratio measurement for testing
 * **forceResolution** - force a resolution measurement for testing

## Other Solutions

Responsihumina is heavily based on [Adaptive Images] (https://github.com/MattWilcox/Adaptive-Images) by Matt Wilcox and [Foresight.js] (https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js) by Adam Bradley, both of which are fantastic solutions to the same problem that attack it from a different angle.
